## Conclusions
- Based on the univariate, bivariate and multivariate analysis. Following are the driving factors or variables which would affect whether a person would default on loan or not.
1. Interest Rate:- Higher the interest rate there are high chances of default.
2. Loan Term- Higher the loan term, higher chances of default.
3. Purpose- People who take loan for small businesses have higher chances of default. 
4. Annual Income- As the Annaul income increases the chance of default decreases.
5. Revol Until- As the revol until percentge increases, the chances of default also increases.

7. Installement:- As the installement increases the chances of default also increases.
